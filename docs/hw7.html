<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>

You will be building a route-finding tool. It will take the names or ids of two buildings 
on the RPI Troy Campus, and generate directions for the shortest route between them, 
using your graph ADT to represent buildings and pathways between them. For now you will 
provide a simple text interface. In Homework 9 you will write a graphical user interface (GUI). 
In this homework, you will write a complete application runnable from the command line via 
a <tt>main</tt> method. <font color="red">You will have to name your main class 
<tt>CampusPaths.java</tt> for testing on Submitty.</font></p>

<p>In this assignment, you will practice modular design, writing code for reuse and 
design patterns. (As before, you get to choose what classes to write and what data
and methods each should have.) Specifically, you will practice the model-view-controller
design pattern. In Homework 9 you will <b>reuse</b> your model with more sophisticated 
view and controller.
</p>

<p>
  For organization, this assignment contains one "problem" for each logical
  component you will write. The order of the problems is not meant to suggest an
  order of implementation. <b>Carefully design</b> the whole system before attempting 
  to implement any part. Design with "low coupling" and the "open/close principle" in mind: 
  you should be able to extend your system with a GUI interface, while in the same
  time the heart of your system (your model) remains insulated from the change.  
  As always, you should develop incrementally, which may mean repeatedly writing 
  a bit of all the parts and verifying that they work together.
</p>

<h2 id="MVC">Model-View-Controller</h2>
<p>
  You will design your application according to
  the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern described below. MVC is a 
  variation of the Observer design pattern.
</p>

<p>
  As you design and implement your solution, please list which parts of your
  code belong to the model, the view, the controller, or none of the above
  in <tt>answers/mvc.pdf</tt>. Often this can be on a per-class level, but
  when a class implements both the view and controller, you must indicate which
  methods or lines logically represent the view and which represent the
  controller. <em>Be sure to list ALL classes you write for Homework 7.</em>
  This just should be a list of classes; you don't need to write any
  sentences of explanation.
</p>

<h3 id="mvc-components">The Three Pieces: Model, View, Controller</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    The <strong>model</strong> consists of the classes that represent data, as
    well as the classes that load, store, look up, or operate on data. These
    classes know nothing about what information is displayed to the user and how
    it is formatted. Rather, the model exposes observer methods the view can
    call to get the information it needs.
    <p>
      In general, functionality of a model includes:
    </p>

    <ul>
	  <li>Reading data from the data source (text file, database, etc.) to an
	  in-memory representation.</li>
	  <li>Storing data while the program is running.</li>
	  <li>Providing methods for the view to access data.</li>
	  <li>Performing computations or operations involving the data and returning
	    the result.</li>
	  <li>Updating the in-memory state (if the application allows the user to
	    modify data).</li>
      <li>Writing to the data source (text file, database, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>view</strong> implements the user interface. It should store as
    little data and perform as little computation as possible; instead,
    it should rely on the model for data storage and manipulation. The view
    decides how the user sees and interacts with this data.
    <p>
      Does the user interact with a text interface or a GUI? What does the user
      type and/or click to get directions from one building to another? How are those
      directions formatted for display? What message does the user see upon
      requesting directions to an unknown building?  These are questions the
      view answers.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>controller</strong> listens to user input. Based on
    the user's keystrokes, mouse clicks, etc., the controller determines their
    intentions and dispatches to the appropriate methods in the model or view.

    <p>
      For a simple interface like in this assignment, the
      view and controller may be intermingled somewhat in code. Don't worry too
      much about the separation there; the key point for now is that the model
      is cleanly separated and reusable.
</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="model-view-interaction">Model-View Interaction</h3>

<p>
  In general, avoid the temptation to create an oversized "god class" that does
  everything for the model. The model may contain multiple classes, and the
  view can interact with multiple classes in the model. Most of the time, any
  class that exists solely to represent data is part of the model. For this
  assignment, you will likely choose to have one central model class that
  manages the graph and does most of the heavy lifting, but you will likely also
  want some smaller objects that encapsulate related data. Some of these objects
  might be returned to the view so it can access their data directly, avoiding
  the "god class" scenario; others might be used only internally within the
  model.
</p>

<p>
  Your model should be completely independent of the view (UI), which means it
  shouldn't know or decide how data is displayed. The model does know something
  about what data and operations the application needs, and it should provide
  methods to access them; however, it shouldn't return strings tailored to a
  particular view and definitely shouldn't contain <tt>println</tt>s. Imagine replacing
  your text UI with a GUI or a Spanish/Mandarin/Klingon text UI (but with the
  same English building names) and ask yourself: is my model reusable with
  this new view?
</p>

<p>
  On the flip side, the view doesn't know anything about how
  the model stores data internally. Someone writing a view for your application
  should only know that the model somehow stores buildings and paths on campus
  and should only interact with the data at this level. In other words, the
  public interface of the model should give no indication that this data is
  represented internally as a graph. That level of detail is irrelevant to the
  view, and revealing it publicly means the model can no longer change its
  implementation without potentially breaking view code.
</p>

<h2 id="Problem1">Problem 1: Parsing the Data</h2>
<p>
  We have added two .csv data files to <tt>data/</tt> to be parsed
  by your application:  <tt>RPI_map_data_Nodes.csv</tt>
  and <tt>RPI_map_data_Edges.csv</tt>.
  The <tt>.csv</tt> files are comma-separated value files that
  can be opened in any text editor, just like <tt>marvel.csv</tt>. Their format is
  described in more detail below.  
</p>

<!--
<p>
  As usual, your program should look for files using relative
  filenames starting at <tt>hw7/</tt>, e.g., <tt>hw7/data/RPI_map_data_Edges.csv</tt>.
</p>
-->

<p>
  You will write a parser to load the data from these files into memory. You may
  use <tt>MarvelParser.java</tt> as a general example of how to read and parse a
  file, keeping in mind that the new data files are structured differently
  from the Marvel data file.
</p>

<p>
  The file <tt>RPI_map_data_Nodes.csv</tt> lists all buildings on campus
  along with their pixel coordinates on the campus map.
  (The campus map can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/academics/courses/spring18/csci2600/RPI_campus_map_2010_extra_nodes_edges.png">the course Web site</a>. 
   You will use this image in Homework 9 when you will be building a GUI interface to 
   the route finding application.)  
  File <tt>RPI_map_data_Nodes.csv</tt> has two parts. 
  The first part lists all the buildings on campus, where each line has four ", " separated fields:
</p>
<pre>Name, id, x-coordinate, y-coordinate
</pre>

<p>
  where <em>Name</em> is the full name of the building, <em>id</em> is the building id, 
  and <em>x-coordinate</em> and <em>y-coordinate</em> are the coordinates on the map. 
  There may be spaces in the building names.
</p>

<p>
  The second part of file <tt>RPI_map_data_Nodes.csv</tt> shows the intersections 
  on the map. The intersections have no name, hence the name field is empty.
</p>

<p>
  The file <tt>RPI_map_data_Edges.csv</tt> lists pairs of building and intersection ids:
</p>
<p>
<pre>id1,id2</pre>
</p> 
  
<p>
 which means that there is a pathway between the building or intersection denoted by id1
 and the one denoted by id2. Pathways are bi-directional: 
 <em>id1</em>,<em>id2</em> means that there is a path from id1 to id2 
 and also from id2 to id1.  
</p>

<p>
Your task is to parse these two files and build a graph that represents the RPI campus
map. For this assignment, you will compute the length of a pathway from the coordinates
of the end points by applying the distance formula. 
</p>


<h2 id="Problem2">Problem 2: The Model</h2>

<p>
  As described above, the model handles the data and contains the major logic
  and computation of your program. For this assignment, a key function of the
  model will be finding the shortest route between two building on campus. This can
  be accomplished by using Dijkstra's algorithm or A* to find a shortest path in the
  graph, where edge weights represent the pathway length.
</p>

<h2 id="Problem3">Problem 3: The Controller and View</h2>
<p>
  In this homework, you will write a simple text interface. When the program is
  launched through the <tt>main</tt> method, it repeatedly prompts the user for
  one of the following one-character commands:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>b</em> lists all buildings (only buildings) in the form <tt>name,id</tt> in 
        lexicographic (alphabetical) order of name.</li>
	<li><em>r</em> prompts the user for the ids or names of two buildings (only buildings!)
	  and prints directions for the shortest route between them.</li>
	<li><em>q</em> quits the program. (Note: this command should simply cause
      the main method to return. Calling <tt>System.exit</tt> to
      terminate the program will break the <a href="#Problem4">tests</a>.)</li>
	<li><em>m</em> prints a menu of all commands. Feel free to add functionality. Our tests cover only the functionality specified above.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  When an unknown command is received the program prints the line
</p>

<pre>Unknown option</pre>

<p>Route directions start with</p>
<pre>Path from <em>Name 1</em> to <em>Name 2</em>:
</pre>

<p>where <em>Name 1</em> and <em>Name 2</em> are the full names of the
  two buildings specified by the user. Route directions are then printed with
  one line per pathway. Each line is indented with a single tab and reads:
</p>

<pre>   Walk <em>direction</em> to (<em>Name 3</em>)</pre>

<p>
  where <em>direction</em> is the direction of the pathway and <em>Name 3</em> 
  is the name of the building at the pathway destination. If the pathway destination  
  is an intersection, print 
</p>

<pre>   Walk <em>direction</em> to (<em>Intersection id</em>)</pre>

<p>
  <em>Direction</em> should be one of North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, 
  SouthWest, West and NorthWest. To determine the direction, compute the angle 
  of the destination from direction north clockwise (e.g, angle of 90 degrees is East). 
  This angle falls into one of eight 45 degree circle sectors 
  corresponding to North, NorthEast, East, etc. 
  For example, if the angle is in the sector [22.5, 67.5), the direction is NorthEast.

  
  Finally, print the total distance in pixel units: 
</p>

<pre><em>Total distance: x pixel units.</em></pre>

<p>where <em>x</em> is the sum of the (non-rounded) distances of the
  individual route pathways.</p>

<p>
  The total distance should be rounded to three digits after the decimal point. As in
  Homework 6, we recommend the use of
  <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Formatter.html">format
  strings</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, if one of the two buildings in a route is not in the dataset, the
  program prints the line
</p>
<pre>Unknown building: [Name]</pre>

<p>
  If neither building is in the dataset, the program prints the line twice, once
  for the first building and then for the second one. If there is no route between
  two buildings, your program should print:
</p>

<pre>There is no path from <em>Name 1</em> to <em>Name 2.</em>
</pre>

<p>
To help with formatting, we have provided the output from a sample run of my 
solution in the file <tt>data/sample_output.txt</tt>. This file reflects the 
exact appearance of the console window after running the program, and includes 
both user input and program output. If you run your program with the user input in the file, 
the state of the console should match the file contents exactly (including whitespace). 
The sample file and the descriptions above, taken together, should completely specify 
the output format of your program.                                                                                       
</p>                                                                                                                                            

<!--
<p>
  For this assignment, the logical view and controller may be part of the same
  class.  In this case you must clarify which parts of
  the class are the view and which are the controller in
  <tt>answers/mvc.txt</tt>, as described above.
  Do so by method — or even by line, if
  needed, though we recommend against having a single method contain parts
  of the view and of the controller.
</p>
-->

<h2 id="Problem4">Problem 4: Testing Your Solution</h2>

<p>
  Unlike in previous assignments, the specification is based
  solely on the output of the complete application, as invoked
  through the <tt>main</tt> method. This means that your
  JUnit tests will be different from previous homework assignments.
</p>


<p>
  We provide a class <tt>CampusPathsTest.java</tt>. (You can rename this class as you wish.)
  The <tt>runTest</tt> method takes as parameter the name of the test files, then  
  constructs two file names, one for input and one for output. It temporarily points
  <tt>System.in</tt> and <tt>System.out</tt> to these files
  while it runs your main program. The result is that commands are read from the
  input file and output is printed to the output file. For your tests to run,
  you simply need to add <tt>@Test</tt> methods that call <tt>runTest</tt> with the 
  appropriate argument. Also, you must edit the designated line in <tt>runTest</tt> to invoke your
  main method. 
</p>

<p>
  You will specify the commands for your tests to run
  in <tt>*.test</tt> files. These files simply contain the series of input a
  user would have entered at the command line as the program was running. 
  <!--
  Recall
  from <a href="#Problem3">Problem 3</a> that you can also include blank lines
  or comment lines (starting with #) for readability and documentation, and
  your controller should echo these lines to the output.
  --> 
  For each test, a
  corresponding <tt>.expected</tt> file should contain the output your program
  is expected to print if a user entered that input. 
  Use JUnit to run the tests. <tt>runTest</tt> compares the output in your <tt>.out</tt>
  file against the corresponding <tt>.expected</tt> file.
</p>

<p>
  Reminder: if a test fails, it is often helpful to look at the
  <tt>.out</tt> file. These files are written to
  the <tt>data/</tt> directory. It may be helpful to navigate
  through the file system at the command line rather than in Eclipse.
</p>

<p>
  We have provided one example test in <tt>data/</tt>. Note that the
  <tt>.expected</tt> file only contains newlines printed by the program using
  <tt>System.out.println</tt>. 
</p>

<p><font color="red">It is important that your test data, i.e., <tt>*.test</tt> 
and <tt>*.expected</tt> files, are in directory <tt>data/</tt> and not in directory 
<tt>src/test/java/hw7/</tt>. If you place your test data in <tt>test</tt> Submitty
won't grab the files and will produce FileNotFound Exceptions.</font>
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, you should write JUnit tests
  for <em>every</em> class that is not part of the view or controller.
  You may not need tests for the view and controller.
  One reason is that they typically have very little functionality
  — they act as glue between the UI (which is hard to test
  programmatically) and the model.  Furthermore, end-to-end behavior
  of your application is tested through the specification tests.  You
  may write additional tests for your view and controller if you feel
  there are important cases not covered by your specification tests,
  but avoid creating unnecessary work for yourself by duplicating
  tests.

<h2 id="Hints">Hints</h2>

<h3 id="other-hints">Best Coding Practices</h3>

<p>
  Remember to practice good procedural decomposition: each method should be
  short and represent a single logical operation or common task. In particular,
  it can be tempting to implement your entire view and controller as one long
  method, but strive to keep each method short by factoring operations into
  small helper methods.
</p>

<p>
  Store your data in appropriate types/classes.
  In particular, you should <em>not</em> pack together data into a
  <tt>String</tt> and then later parse the <tt>String</tt> to extract the
  components.
</p>

<p>
  Remember that your graph should be completely hidden within the
  model.  Classes that depend on the model (namely, the view and
  controller) should have no idea that the data is stored in a graph,
  not even from the class documentation. If you decided later to
  switch to a different graph ADT or to do away with the graph
  altogether (for example, by making calls to the Google Maps API to
  find paths), you want to be able to change the model
  without affecting the view and controller, whose job has nothing to
  do with how the data is stored or computed.
</p>

<p>
  As usual, include an abstraction function, representation invariant,
  and checkRep in all classes that represent an ADT. If a class does
  not represent an ADT, place a comment that explicitly says so where
  the AF and RI would normally go. (For example, classes that contain
  only static methods and are never constructed usually do not
  represent an ADT.) You very well may find that you have more non-ADT
  classes on this assignment than in the past. Please come to office
  hours if you feel unsure about what counts as an ADT and what
  doesn't.
</p>

<h3 id="Common-Issues">Common Issues</h3>

<p>
Do not call <tt>System.exit</tt> to terminate your program, as it
will prevent your specification tests from passing.
</p>

<p>
If you use <tt>Scanner</tt> to read user input
from <tt>System.in</tt>, be sure not to call both <tt>next()</tt>
and <tt>nextLine()</tt> on the same <tt>Scanner</tt> object, as the
<tt>Scanner</tt> may misbehave. In particular, some students have
found that it causes their programs to work correctly at the console
but not when they run their tests.  Using <tt>Scanner</tt> is nether
necessary nor required.
</p>

<p>
Floating-point precision and numeric comparisons:
If you do arithmetic over floating-point values (<tt>float</tt>,
<tt>double</tt>), then an exact <tt>==</tt> may not work as expected; for
instance, in Java, <tt>1.2 * 3.0 == 3.6</tt> evaluates to <tt>false</tt>.
Thus, when comparing computed floating-point values, you should use an
approximate comparison, such as that the ratio between the values is very
close to 1.  However, in this assignment you should use <tt>==</tt>.  You
are comparing exact floating-point values that are read from a file,
without doing arithmetic over them.  Doing an approximate comparison is
even wrong, since it would give someone reading the code the impression
that you are computing approximate values.
