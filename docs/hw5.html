<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This homework has two parts. In the first part (Problem 1), you will practice
concepts we discuss in class. In the second part, you will put the graph you designed in Homework 4 to use
by modeling the Marvel Comics universe. By trying out your ADT in a client
application, you will be able to test the usability of your design as well as
the correctness, efficiency, and scalability of your implementation.
You may have to overhaul, or just tweak your implementation, once you 
try it with a larger load.</p>

<p>The application builds a graph containing thousands of nodes and edges.
At this size, you may discover performance issues that weren't revealed by your
unit tests on smaller graphs. With a well-designed implementation, your
program will run in a matter of seconds. Bugs or less ideal choices of data
structures can increase the runtime to anywhere from several
minutes to 30 minutes or more. If this is the case you may want to go back and
revisit your graph implementation from Homework 4. Remember that different
graph representations have widely varying time compelxities for various operations
and this, not a coding bug, may explain the slowness.</p>

<!--
<p>This Marvel dataset was also used by researchers, who
published a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0202174">research paper</a>
showing that the graph is strikingly similar to "real-life" social networks.
</p>

<h3 id="Problem1">Problem 1: Written Exercises [10 points]</h3>

<p>This part is designed to improve your understanding of function subtyping and true subtyping
discussed in lectures.

<h2 id="MarvelPaths">The MarvelPaths Application</h2>
<p>
In this application, your graph models a social network among characters in
Marvel comic books. Each node in the graph represents a character, and an edge
<tt>⟨Char1,Char2⟩</tt> indicates that Char1 appeared in a comic book
that Char2 also appeared in. There should be a separate edge for every comic
book, labeled with the name of the book.  
For example, if Zeus and Hercules appeared in (say) five issues of a
given series, then Zeus would have five edges to Hercules, and Hercules would
have five edges to Zeus.
</p>

<p>
Your graph should not store reflexive edges from characters to themselves.
</p>

<p>
You will write a class <tt>hw5.MarvelPaths</tt> (in file
<tt>MarvelPaths.java</tt> in package <tt>hw5</tt>) that reads the Marvel data
from a file (<tt>marvel.csv</tt>), builds a graph, and finds paths between characters in the graph.
You are not required to write a main method as a
driver for your application; nevertheless, we encourage you to do so, both for
your own convenience and for the satisfaction that comes with creating a
complete, standalone application.
</p>

<p>As you complete this assignment, you may need to modify the implementation
and perhaps the public interface of your Graph ADT from Homework 4. Briefly 
document any changes you made and why in <tt>answers/hw5_changes.pdf</tt> 
(no more than 1-2 sentences per change). If you made no changes, state 
that explicitly. You don't need to track and document cosmetic and other 
minor changes, such as renaming a variable; we are interested in substantial 
changes to your API or implementation, such as adding a public method or 
using a different data structure.  Describe logical changes rather than 
precisely how each line of your code was altered. For example, 
"I switched the data structure for storing all the nodes
from a ___ to a ___ because ___" is more helpful than "I changed line 27
from <tt>nodes = new ___();</tt> to <tt>nodes = new ____();</tt>."
</p>

<p>
Leave your graph in the <tt>hw4</tt> package where it was originally written,
even if you modify it for this assignment. There is no need to copy files
or duplicate code!  You can just <tt>import hw4</tt> and use it in Homework 5. If you do
modify your <tt>hw4</tt> code, be sure to commit your changes to your repository.
</p>

<h3 id="Problem2">Problem 2: Getting the Marvel Universe Data</h3>
<p>
Before you get started, obtain the Marvel Universe dataset. We have not added this 
file to your Git repositories because it is fairly large. Instead, download the file
from <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/academics/courses/spring18/csci2600/marvel.csv">the course Web site</a>. 
Store the file in <tt>data/marvel.csv</tt>. (You will have to add the <tt>data</tt>
directory under <tt>hw5</tt>.)
</p>

<p><font color="red">IMPORTANT: Do not commit the marvel.csv into your repository! There
is a limit on each repository and committing such a large file may break this limit. 
This is easily taken care of in eGit, you can simply exclude marvel.csv. 
</font>
</p>

<!--
This file is a cleaned-up
version of a TSV ("tab-separated value") file  Instead,
<a href="http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/marvel-universe-social-graph">download
the data</a> from Infochimps, unzip the download, and copy and rename the
<tt>labeled_edges.tsv</tt> file inside to <tt>hw5/data/marvel.tsv</tt>. (Note
that although the download page encourages you to create an account, it does
allow you to bypass that step.)
</p>
-->

<p>
Take a moment to inspect the file. A CSV ("comma-separated value") file
consists of human-readable data delineated by commas, and can be opened
in your favorite text editor or Eclipse. Each line in
<tt>marvel.csv</tt> is of the form
</p>
<pre><em>"character"</em>,<em>"book"</em>
</pre>
<p>
where <em>character</em> is the name of a character, <em>book</em> is the title
of a comic book that the character appeared in, and the two fields are separated
by a comma.
</p>

<h3 id="Problem3">Problem 3: Building the Graph [27 points with Problem 4]</h3>
<p>
The first step in your program is to construct your graph of the Marvel universe
from a data file. We have written a class <tt>MarvelParser</tt> that may help.
<tt>MarvelParser</tt> has one static method, <tt>readData()</tt>, which
reads data from
<tt>marvel.csv</tt>, or any file structured in the same format.
<tt>readData()</tt> creates in-memory
data structures:  a <tt>Set</tt> of all characters and a <tt>Map</tt> from each book to
a <tt>Set</tt> of characters in that book. These are not the data
structures you want, however; you want a Graph.
</p>

<p>We have also included a main method which takes the file name as a command-line 
argument and then calls <tt>readData()</tt>. To add <tt>marvel.csv</tt> as a command-line argument
in Eclipse, go to Run->Run Configurations. In the Run Configurations window, choose the 
"Arguments" tab. In "Program Arguments", type <tt>data/marvel.csv</tt>.
</p>

<p><font color="red">
Later on when measuring coverage, you can comment out the main method. (Since it is never
called from the tests, it will decrease your percent coverage.) If you choose not to 
use our parser code, you can get rid of the file altogether. You do need to substitute 
with your own parser code though. 
</font>
</p>

<p>
You may modify <tt>MarvelParser</tt> however you wish to fit your implementation.
You may change the method signature (parameters and return value)
of <tt>parseData()</tt>, or you may leave <tt>parseData()</tt> as is and
write code that processes its output.
The only constraint is that your code needs to take a
filename as a parameter so the parser can be reused with any input file.
</p>

<p>At this point, it's a good idea to test the parsing and graph-building
operation in isolation. Verify that your program builds the graph correctly 
before you go on. The assignment formally requires this in
<a href="#Problem5">Problem 5</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="Problem4">Problem 4: Finding Paths [27 points with Problem 3]</h3>

<p>The real meat (or tofu) of <tt>MarvelPaths</tt> is the ability to find paths
between two characters in the graph. Given the name of two
characters, <tt>MarvelPaths</tt> searches for and returns a path through the
graph connecting them. How the path is subsequently used, or the format in which
it is printed out, depends on the requirements of the particular application
using <tt>MarvelPaths</tt>. 
</p>

<p>Your program should return the shortest path found via
breadth-first search (BFS).  A BFS from node u to node v visits all of
u's neighbors first, then all of u's neighbors' neighbors, then all
of u's neighbors' neighbors' neighbors, and so on until v is found or all nodes
with a path from u have been visited. Below is a general BFS
pseudocode algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a
graph G. For readability, you should use more descriptive variable
names in your actual code than are needed in the pseudocode:</p>

<pre>    start = starting node
    dest = destination node
    Q = queue, or "worklist", of nodes to visit: initially empty
    M = map from nodes to paths: initially empty.
        // Each key in M is a visited node.
        // Each value is a path from start to that node.
        // A path is a list; you decide whether it is a list of nodes, or edges,
        // or node data, or edge data, or nodes and edges, or something else.
    
    Add start to Q
    Add start-&gt;[] to M (start mapped to an empty list)
    while Q is not empty:
        dequeue next node n
        if n is dest
            return the path associated with n in M
        for each edge e=⟨n,m⟩:
            if m is not in M, i.e. m has not been visited:
                let p be the path n maps to in M
                let p' be the path formed by appending e to p
                add m-&gt;p' to M
                add m to Q
            
    If the loop terminates, then no path exists from start to dest.
    The implementation should indicate this to the client.
</pre>

<p>
Here are some facts about the algorithm.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    It is a loop invariant that every element of Q is a key in M
  </li>
  <li>
    If the graph were not a multigraph, the for loop could have been equivalently expressed as <tt>for each neighbor
    m of n:</tt>
  </li>
  <li>
    If a path exists from start to dest, then the algorithm returns a
    shortest path.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Many character pairs will have multiple paths. <strong>For grading purposes, 
your program should return the lexicographically (alphabetically) least path.
</strong>  More precisely, it should pick the lexicographically first character 
at each next step in the path, and if those characters appear in several comic 
books together, it should print the lexicographically lowest title of a comic 
book that they both appear in. The BFS algorithm above can be easily modified to
support this ordering: in the for-each loop, visit edges in increasing order
of <em>m</em>'s character name, with edges to the same character visited in
increasing order of comic book title. This is <em>not</em> meant to imply that
your graph should store data in this order; it is merely a convenience for
grading.</p>

<p>
Because of this application-specific behavior,
you should implement your BFS algorithm in <tt>MarvelPaths</tt> rather
than directly in your graph, as other hypothetical applications that might need
BFS probably would not need this special ordering.
Further, other applications using the graph ADT might need to use a 
different search algorithm, so we don't want to hard-code a particular 
search algorithm in the graph ADT.
</p>

<p>
Using the full Marvel dataset, your program must be able to construct the graph
and find a path in just a couple of seconds on your PC/laptop and on the Submitty. 
When running tests we will set a 60 second timeout for each test suite. Note that if 
your solution exceeds the limit, your process is cut then the output file is cut 
and you may get strange Error message about incorrect formatting of the output file.  
</p>

<p>
Similarly to Homework 4, add an instance field that stores a Graph in <tt>MarvelPaths</tt>.
For testing purposes, we require that you implement the following public methods in <tt>MarvelPaths</tt>.
Otherwise, design class <tt>MarvelPaths</tt> as you wish and add operations as you wish.
</p>

<dt><tt>public void createNewGraph(String filename)</tt></dt>
<dd>
<p>
The method creates a brand new graph in the instance field in <tt>MarvelPaths</tt>
and populates the graph from <i>filename</i>, where <i>filename</i> is a data 
file of the format defined for <tt>marvel.csv</tt> and is located in the <tt>data/</tt>
directory of your project. 
<pp>
</dd>

<dt><tt>public String findPath(String <i>node1</i>, String <i>node2</i>)</tt></dt>
<dd>
<p>
Find the shortest path from <i>node1</i> to <i>node2</i> in the graph using
your breadth-first search algorithm. 
</p>

<p>Paths should be chosen using the
lexicographic ordering described above. If a path
is found, the returned String should contain the path in the format below.
That is, <tt>System.out.println(mp.findPath("CHAR1","CHARN")</tt>
where <tt>mp</tt> refers to an instance of <tt>MarpvelPaths</tt>, prints the following:
</p>

<pre>path from <em>CHAR1</em> to <em>CHARN</em>:
<em>CHAR1</em> to <em>CHAR2</em> via <em>BOOK1</em>
<em>CHAR2</em> to <em>CHAR3</em> via <em>BOOK2</em>
...
<em>CHARN-1</em> to <em>CHARN</em> via <em>BOOKN-1</em>
</pre>
<p>
where <em>CHAR1</em> is the first node listed in the arguments to findPath,
<em>CHARN</em> is the second node listed in the arguments, and <em>BOOKK</em>
is the title of a book that <em>CHARK</em> and <em>CHARK+1</em> appeared in.
</p>

<p>For example, <tt>mp.findPath("Zena","Zeus")</tt> will construct and return
the String <tt>"path from Zena to Zeus:\nZena to Hercules via Book1\nHercules to Zeus via Book2\n"</tt>. 
(We are just making this up to illustrate the placement of newline characters, 
there is no such a path in the Marvel universe.)
</p>

<p>Not all characters may have a path between them. If the user gives two valid
node arguments that have no path in the specified graph, output the following as String:</p>
<pre>path from <em>CHAR 1</em> to <em>CHAR N</em>:
no path found
</pre>

<p>If a character name <em>CHAR</em> was not in the original dataset, simply
output:</p>
<pre>unknown character <em>CHAR</em>
</pre>
<p>
If neither character is in the original dataset, output the line twice: first for the first node, then for the second one. 
These should be the only lines your program
produces in this case — i.e., do not output the regular "path from ..." or
"path not found" output.
</p>

<p>
What if the user asks for the path from a character in the dataset to
itself?
A trivially empty path is different from no path at all,
so the "no path found" output isn't appropriate here. But there are no edges
to print, either. So you should output the header line
</p>
<pre>path from <em>C</em> to <em>C</em>:</pre>
<p>but nothing else.
(Hint: a well-written solution
requires no special handling of this case.)
</p>

<p>This only applies to characters in the dataset: a request for a path
from a character that is not in the dataset to itself should have
the usual "unknown character <em>C</em>" output.</p>

<p>In all cases the string should end with <tt>\n</tt> (newline), just
like in the first case.</p>

</dd>
</dl>


<h3 id="Problem5">Problem 5: Testing Your Solution [12 points]</h3>
<p>
Because the Marvel graph contains literally thousands of nodes and hundreds of
thousands of edges, using it for correctness testing is probably a bad idea.  By
contrast, using it for scalability testing is a great idea, but should come
after correctness testing has been completed using much smaller graphs. In
addition, it is important to be able to test your parsing/graph-building and
BFS operations in isolation, separately from each other. 
<!--
For these reasons,
you will use a test driver to verify the correctness of both your parser and BFS
algorithm on much smaller graphs, as you did in Homework 4.
-->
</p>

You should first write <tt>*.csv</tt> files in
the <a href="#Problem2">format</a> defined for <tt>marvel.csv</tt> to test your
<tt>MarvelPaths</tt>. All these files will go in the
<tt>data/</tt> directory.
</p>

<p>
Write tests in the regular JUnit test class in folder <tt>src/test/java/hw5</tt> (use <tt>hw5</tt> package). You might 
have to create the folder <tt>src/test/java/hw5</tt> and specify that you want to put your test class in the <tt>hw5</tt> package. Make sure that you handle
the edge cases. You will have to specify data files to load in your implementation tests, 
<b><font color="red">so make sure you read the <a href="#File-Paths">File Paths</a> section 
for information about specifying filenames very carefully.</font></b> 
</p>

<p>
As in Homework 4, run EclEmma and measure coverage of your tests. We will be measuring coverage too. The code coverage threshold will be set at 90% for this assignment.
</p>


<h3 id="reflection">Reflection [0.5 points]</h3>

<p>Please answer the following questions in a file named <tt>hw5_reflection.pdf</tt>

<h2 id="File-Paths">Paths to Files</h2>
<p>
When you use test files in <tt>data/</tt>, hardcode the relative path in your tests.
For example, if you use file <tt>testfile1.csv</tt> in directory <tt>data/</tt>,
you can load the file using <tt>BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("data/testfile1.csv"))</tt>.
</p>
<!--p>
<font color="red"><b>Do not use <tt>src/hw5/data/testfile1.csv</tt> because Submitty assumes
relative path <tt>"data/testfile1.csv"</tt> and prepending <tt>src/</tt> will result in FileNotFoundException
and a grade of 0.</b> Because Eclipse searches for files relative from your project directory 
(which is the default Working Directory),
the default compilation configuration does require prepending <tt>src/</tt> to the path. To run
without having to prepend <tt>src</tt>, go to Run Configuration -> Arguments, then in Working Directory, 
click Other, then append <tt>src</tt> to whatever shows in the Default box. E.g., in my case, 
I typed <tt>${workspace_loc:csci2600}/src</tt>, where <tt>${workspace_loc:csci2600}</tt> was
the default Working Directory. Relative paths <tt>"hw5/data/testfile1.csv"</tt> should work 
with this configuration.
</font></p-->

<p>Behavior may vary from one version of Eclipse to another. As long as you hardcode your relative paths
starting at <tt>data/</tt> you will be fine on Submitty.
</p>




<h2 id="Hints">Hints</h2>
<h3 id="Performance">Performance</h3>

<p>
If your program takes an excessively long time to construct the graph for the
full Marvel dataset, first make sure that it parses the data and builds the
graph correctly for a very small dataset. If it does, here are a few questions
to consider:
</p>
<ul>
<li>What data structures are you using in your graph? What is their "big-O" runtime? Are there others that are
better suited to the purpose?</li>
<li>Did you remember to correctly override <tt>hashCode()</tt> if you overrode
<tt>equals()</tt>?</li>
<li>What is the "big-O" runtime of your <tt>checkRep()</tt> function? Does
performance improve if you comment it out?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>As always, remember to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use descriptive variables names (especially in the BFS algorithm)
    and inline comments as appropriate.</li>
  <li>Include an abstraction function, representation invariant, and
    checkRep in all classes that represent an ADT. If a class does not
    represent an ADT, place a comment that explicitly says so where
    the AF and RI would normally go. (For example, classes that
    contain only static methods and are never constructed usually do
    not represent an ADT.) Please come to office hours if you feel
    unsure about what counts as an ADT and what doesn't.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Turnin">What to Submit</h2>
<p>You should add and commit the following files to your hw04 Git repository:</p>

<ul>
    <li><tt>src/main/java/hw5/MarvelPaths.java</tt></li>
