<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>
In Homework 7, you wrote a program that found shortest routes between buildings on the RPI Campus. 
Now we are asking for a graphical user interface (GUI) that visually draws routes.
</p>

<p>
You will build your GUI using Java's Swing and Abstract Windowing Toolkit
(AWT) libraries. In completing this assignment, you will get practice using
Swing, event-driven programming, and the MVC (Observer) design pattern.
</p>

<!--
<p>
When you're done, you can share your finished work with family and
friends by following
the <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse331/13sp/hws/hw8/how-to-create-a-jar.html">instructions for creating a JAR
file</a>.
</p>
-->

<p>
You are expected to fix any bugs from Homework 7 that affect the
correctness or performance of your application in Homework 9. Furthermore,
your Homework 9 should use the model you created in Homework 7. This may
require that you modify your Homework 7 code, that is OK, but be sure
that Homework 7 continues to pass all tests!
</p>

<p>There is no auto-grading on this assignment. However, you still must 
submit through Submitty.</p>

<h2 id="Requirements">GUI Requirements</h2>

<p>
You will write a GUI and a main class to launch it
named <tt>RPICampusPathsMain.java</tt>. This assignment is deliberately 
open-ended:
the exact appearance and functionality of your GUI are up to you. The only
requirements are documented below.
</p>

<p>
For the most part, we are not grading on aesthetics: it doesn't matter
whether your GUI looks pretty as long as it implements the required
features. Nevertheless, a design which is genuinely confusing or hard
to use (at our discretion) may not receive full credit. For example,
we will deduct points if we can't easily figure out how to select the
two buildings, if it's hard to see the selected path, or if we can
only see the whole GUI on a 27-inch monitor. In addition, your
program should be generally responsive: for instance, the GUI should
not take an unusually long time to find and display paths.
</p>

<p>
Your GUI is a new View and Controller for your Campus Paths application.
Ideally, you should not have to make any changes to your Homework 7
model classes â€” they already implement all the Model functionality
that you need.  If you have to make any small changes (for instance, if
your design in Homework 7 was poor and some model methods were too closely tied to
your text view), then you may do so.  As always, all tests from previous
homeworks must continue to pass, so you may also need to change your
Homework 7 View and Controller in that case.  In file
<tt>answers/model-changes.pdf</tt>, list any changes you made to the model.
For each, write a 1 - 2 sentence explanation of why the change was necessary
and what you could have done differently on Homework 7 to create a more general
and reusable Model. If you made no changes, write "None" for this section.
</p>

<h3 id="Screen-Resolution">Window size</h3>
<p>At startup, your GUI must fit and be usable on a screen with a
1024 x 768 resolution.  (You may wish to support resizing
the window, but doing so is not required.) Most computers provide a
way to change the screen resolution, which you can use for testing.</p>

<h3 id="Required-Features">Required features</h3>
<p>At a minimum, your GUI must provide the following features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>At startup, load the map data
	from <tt>data/RPI_map_data_Edges.csv</tt>
	and <tt>data/RPI_map_data_Nodes.csv</tt> which you should already have in your repository from Homework 7. (This
	should be in your model, not your view.  There is no need to
	duplicate files; load them directly from  the <tt>data/</tt> directory.)</li>
	<li>Display the map of RPI campus. 
        You may remove the part at the bottom with the building names if you need.
	<font color="red">(Important note: download the map from the course
       <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/academics/courses/spring18/csci2600/RPI_campus_map_2010_extra_nodes_edges.png">Web site</a>
	and save it into your <tt>data/</tt> directory: <tt>data/RPI_campus_map_2010_extra_nodes_edges.png</tt>.
	DO NOT commit the map as the large file may break the limit on repo size.
	When testing, we will copy the map into your <tt>data/</tt> directory under the name 
        <tt>RPI_campus_map_2010_extra_nodes_edges.png</tt>.)
        </font>
        </li>
	<li>Allow the user to select two buildings for finding a route.
	You might use free-text entry, dropdown menus, selection with the
	mouse, or some other approach.</li>
	<li>Mark the selected buildings and/or path endpoints on the map.</li>
	<li>Draw the shortest route between the selected buildings on the map. 
          Ideally the map should automatically be zoomed in or out when a route
	  is drawn, so that the route is almost as large as possible while still
	  fitting in the window, but this is not required.</li>
	<li>Allow the user to reset the GUI by clicking a reset
	button. This button should clear all markings on the map and all
	other controls (such as building selectors), setting the GUI back to its
	initial state.</li>
	<li>Operate robustly: No matter what the user does, your program should
	never allow an exception message to bubble up to the console window, and
	your GUI should never crash or reach a buggy/invalid state.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Swing-Widgets">Swing widgets and GUI builders</h3>

<p>
Use only components from the
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/">Swing</a>
widget set for this assignment.  You are also allowed to use components
from
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/awt/">AWT</a>, on
which Swing is built, but should try to stick to Swing when possible.
</p>

<p>
Some IDEs, such as NetBeans, will let you specify the appearance and behavior of
your GUI and automatically generate the code for you. You may not use these
tools; you must write your GUI from scratch in Java.
</p>

<h3 id="Launching-GUI">Launching your GUI</h3>

<p>We will launch your GUI from Run As --> Java Application.</p>

<h2 id="Additional-Features">Optional Extra Features</h2>
<p>
We encourage you to get creative with both the appearance and functionality of
your GUI! If you do, <strong> make sure to get a basic GUI working and commit it
to your repository</strong> before experimenting. Swing can be finicky, and
seemingly simple UI improvements often become big time sinks. If you've
committed your working solution, you can always "roll back" to that revision
later.
</p>

<p>
If you want an extra challenge, you are encouraged to implement additional features.
Here are a few ideas:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>As the window is resized, make the map shrink or grow to fit the
	window.</li>
	<li>Maintain the proportions of the map so that it zooms in on a route
	without becoming distorted.</li>
        <li>Place the map in a <tt>ScrollPane</tt> so it can be displayed full-size. When displaying a route 
        or buildings, jump to that spot on the map to resize if needed. (Hint: you probably need to override 
        <tt>getPreferredSize()</tt> in your "canvas" class for scrolling to work.)</li>
	<li>Allow the user to select the endpoints of a path by clicking with the mouse on the map.</li>
	<li>Allow the user to drag the map with the mouse to change the portion that is shown.</li>
	<li>Add zoom buttons, possibly with a way to recenter the image for zooming if a hand 
         is not available to drag it (e.g., mouse double click).</li>
</ul>

<p>
  List any additional features you implemented, if any,
  in <tt>answers/extra.txt</tt>.  You must commit a <tt>answers/extra.txt</tt> file,
  even if it simply contains "None".  Additional features must not mask or
  replace any of the <a href="#Required-Features"> required
  features</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Extra credit will be awarded for interesting or
  useful functionality that shows considerable effort. Extra credit will not be
  awarded for pure "eye candy," such as changing the font and color of buttons
  or adding a border. 
</p>

<p>
  Writing automated tests for GUIs is difficult and usually involves special
  frameworks that are beyond the scope of this course. For this reason, you are
  not required to write unit tests. We will test your solution by running your main program.

</p>


<h2 id="Hints">Hints</h2>

<h3 id="General-Advice">General GUI Advice</h3>

<p>If you've never used Swing, it is well worth your time to do some
tutorials, read the example code, and generally get comfortable with
GUI programming before diving into the assignment. You can start by
studying the examples that came with the GUI lecture.</p>

<p>Abstraction functions, representation invariants, and checkRep() are not
required for GUI classes because they generally do not represent ADTs.</p>

<p>User testing is a great way to verify that your interface is as easy to use
as you think it is. Show your GUI to your friend/roommate/sibling.  Can they
figure out how to use it without directions from you?  
</p>

<p>As usual, remember to practice good method and class decomposition among
other best practices for style. In particular, your GUI constructor
and <tt>paintComponent</tt> will probably be long enough that they
should be broken into helper methods. Apply refactoring if you feel 
that a method or class has become too large.</p>

<h3 id="Using-Swing">Programming With Swing</h3>

<p>In addition to the lecture slides and demos,
Oracle's <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/">Swing</a>
and <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/index.html">2-D
Graphics</a> tutorials are a useful resource. Also remember
to use the
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?overview-summary.html">Java
API</a>, particularly 
the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html"><tt>javax.swing</tt></a>
and <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/package-summary.html"><tt>java.awt</tt></a>
packages, to see what classes and methods are available and how to use them.
</p>

<p>To display the routes, you will want to write a custom component and
override
<tt>paintComponent()</tt>.  You will
use <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics.html"><tt>Graphics</tt></a>
and/or <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics2D.html"><tt>Graphics2D</tt></a>
to do the rendering, as we saw in lecture.</p>

<p>If you have trouble getting things to display at the correct size, make sure
you have remembered to call <tt>pack()</tt> before setting your frame to be
visible.</p>

<h2 id="Turnin">What to Turn In</h2>

<p>You should add and commit the following files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>src/main/java/hw9/RPICampusPathsMain.java</tt></li>
  <li><tt>src/main/java/hw9/*.java</tt> <em>[your GUI classes]</em></li>
  <li><tt>answers/model-changes.pdf</tt> <em>[list of changes to HW7.  The file may simply contain "None".]</em></li>
  <li><tt>answers/extra.pdf</tt> <em>[list of optional features you implemented.  The file may simply contain "None".]</em></li>
  <li><tt>answers/hw9_reflection.pdf</tt></li>
  <li><tt>answers/hw9_collaboration.pdf</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, be sure to commit any updates you make to your Homework 7
files.</p>
