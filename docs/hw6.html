<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>
This assignment lays the groundwork for an application you'll build in homework assignments
7 and 9. Using your graph as the underlying data structure, your application 
will generate directions for getting around buildings on RPI Campus.
</p>

<p>
This assignment has two main parts. In the first part, you will make your graph
class(es) generic. In the second part, you will implement a different
path-finding algorithm for graphs known as Dijkstra's algorithm. 
</p>

<h2 id="Problems">Augmenting Your Graph and Marvel Paths</h2>

<h3 id="Problem1">Problem 1: Making Your Graph Generic</h3>
<p>
In the application you'll be building in subsequent homeworks, your mission 
is to find the shortest route to visit a certain set of buildings.  
A graph is an excellent representation of a map,
and luckily you have already specified and implemented a graph.
Unfortunately, your graph only stores <tt>String</tt>s, whereas the route-finding 
application needs to store non-String data types in the nodes and edges. 
More generally, your graph would be
much more widely useful if only the client could choose the data types to be
stored in nodes and edges. Herein lies the power of generics!
</p>

<p>
Your task is to convert your graph ADT to a generic class. Rather than always
storing the data in nodes and edge labels as <tt>String</tt>s, it should have
two type parameters representing the data types to be stored in nodes and
edges. Directly modify your existing classes under <tt>hw4</tt> —
there is no need to copy or duplicate code.
</p>

<p>
When you are done, your previously-written HW4 and HW5 tests and 
<tt>MarvelPaths</tt> will no longer compile. Modify these classes to
construct and use graph objects parameterized with Strings. All code must
compile and all tests must pass when you submit your homework. 
Depending on your changes, some of your tests may no longer
be valid.  Try to adapt your tests to your new implementation,
or discard them and write the new ones:  they should help you build confidence
in your implementation.  But, don't overdo it:  as with any testing, stop
when you feel that the additional effort is not being repaid in terms of
increased confidence in your implementation.  
</p>

<h4 id="building-generics">Build tools and generic code</h4>

<p>
We want you to configure Eclipse to show generics problems as errors.
By default, Eclipse shows generics problems as warnings (indicated by 
yellow lines and markers). You can configure Eclipse to instead issue 
errors (indicated by red lines and markers) for these problems. 
Doing so will help you remember to write acceptable generics code.
</p>

<p>
To make this configuration, go to Eclipse &gt;&gt; Preferences and select Java &gt;&gt; Compiler &gt;&gt; Errors/Warnings. 
Under Generic types, change the value of Unchecked generic type operation to Error.
</p>

<p>
(Note that there is another setting named "Usage of a raw type" that is set 
to Ignore by default. We recommend leaving this option disabled or set 
simply to Warn because it is specific to the Eclipse compiler and checks 
for more stringent requirements than required by the Java language specification. 
Thus, "Usage of raw type" may complain about issues, that while providing insight 
about your code, is not checked by Oracle's javac, which is our official standard 
for compilation errors and warnings in this class.) 
</p>


<p>
Hint: Sometimes you may find that classes which
previously compiled are now reporting "[some class] cannot be resolved" errors
in Eclipse. You can fix these errors by doing a clean build: go to Project
&gt;&gt; Properties &gt;&gt; Clean..., select your <tt>csci2600</tt> project, and
hit OK.
</p>


<h3 id="Problem2">Problem 2: Weighted Graphs and Least-Cost Paths </h3>
<p>
In a <em>weighted graph</em>, 
the label on each edge is a <em>length</em>, <em>cost</em>, or
<em>weight</em> representing the
cost of traversing that edge. Depending on the application, the cost may be
measured in time, money, physical distance, etc. The total cost of a path is the
sum of the costs of all edges in that path, and the <em>minimum-cost path</em>
between two nodes is the path with the lowest total cost between those nodes.
</p>

<h4 id="Dijkstras_algorithm">Dijkstra's algorithm</h4>

<p>
You will implement 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijkstra's
algorithm</a>, which finds a minimum-cost path between two given nodes
in a graph with all nonnegative edge weights. Below is a pseudocode
algorithm that you may use in your implementation. You are free to
modify it as long as you are essentially still implementing Dijkstra's
algorithm. Your implementation of the algorithm may assume a graph
with <tt>Double</tt> edge weights.
</p>

<p>
The algorithm uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue">priority queue</a>. 
<!--
You should be familiar with this data structure from Homework 4. In Homework 4 the <tt>remove</tt> 
operation removed the greatest value stored in the queue. For the purposes of Dijkstra's
algorithm, <tt>remove</tt> must remove the least value.
--> 
The standard Java libraries include an implementation of a
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/PriorityQueue.html"><tt>PriorityQueue</tt></a>.
</p>

<pre class="code_block">    Dijkstra's algorithm assumes a graph with all nonnegative edge weights.

    start = starting node
    dest = destination node
    active = priority queue.  Each element is a path from start to a given node.
             A path's "priority" in the queue is the total cost of that path.
             Nodes for which no path is known yet are not in the queue.
    finished = set of nodes for which we know the minimum-cost path from start.

    // Initially we only know of the path from start to itself, which has a cost
    // of zero because it contains no edges.
    Add a path from start to itself to active

    while active is non-empty:
        // minPath is the lowest-cost path in active and is the minimum-cost
        // path for some node
        minPath = active.removeMin()
        minDest = destination node in minPath
        
        if minDest is dest:
            return minPath

        if minDest is in finished:
            continue

        for each edge e = ⟨minDest, child⟩:
            // If we don't know the minimum-cost path from start to child,
            // examine the path we've just found
            if child is not in finished:
                newPath = minPath + e
                add newPath to active

        add minDest to finished

    If the loop terminates, then no path exists from start to dest.
    The implementation should indicate this to the client.
</pre>

<h4 id="Marvel">Dijkstra's Algorithm in Marvel Paths</h4>
<p>
You will write a modified version of your Marvel Paths application in 
which your application finds its paths using Dijkstra's algorithm 
instead of BFS. Dijkstra's algorithm requires weighted edges. To 
simulate edge weights over the Marvel dataset, the weight of the edge 
between two characters will be based on how well-connected those two 
characters are. Specifically, the weight is the inverse of how many 
comic books two characters are in together (equivalently, the weight is 
the multiplicative inverse of the number of edges in the multigraph 
between
them). For example, if Amazing Amoeba and Zany Zebra appeared in 5 comic
 books together, the weight of the edge between them would be 1/5. Thus,
 the more well-connected two characters are, the lower the weight and 
the more likely that a path is taken through them. In summary, the idea 
with the Marvel data is to treat the number of paths from one node to 
another as a "distance" — if there are several edges from one node to 
another then that is a "shorter" distance than another pair of nodes 
that are only connected by a single edge.
</p>

<div>Things to note:</div>
<ul style="margin-top: 0px;">
	<li>
	  A path from a character to itself is defined to have cost 0.0.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Calculations for the weight of the edges in your graph should be done
 when the graph is loaded. This assignment is different from the last 
one in that when the graph is initialized there is only one edge between
 nodes and that edge is the weighted edge. The one edge between any two 
characters will have the label containing the multiplicative inverse of 
how many books they share.
	</li>
	<li>
    On graph initialization, there will be at most one edge between two 
Marvel characters, but the addEdge functionality still allows adding 
multiple weighted edges between two characters.  You must be sure that 
path-finding will use the least cost edge if there are multiple edges 
between two characters.  In other words, if a new edge is added to your 
graph after its initialization, then path-finding should be able to 
factor that edge into its calculations without re-calculating the 
weights of other edges or deleting/overwriting any existing edges.
	</li>
</ul>


<p>
Place your new Marvel application
in <tt>src/main/java/hw6/MarvelPaths2.java</tt> in package <tt>hw6</tt>. In choosing how to organize your
code, remember to avoid duplicating code as much as possible. In
particular, reuse existing code where possible, and keep in mind that
you may need to use the same implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in
a different application.</p>

<p>
<!-- in 13wi: 30 seconds. -->
For this assignment, your program must be able to construct the graph and find
a path in less than <strong>30</strong> seconds using the full Marvel
dataset. We will set the tests to have a 3000 ms (30 second) timeout
for each test and run with assertions disabled.
</p>

<p>
As before, you are welcome to write a <tt>main()</tt> method for your
application, but you are not required to do so.
</p>

<!--
<h4 id="Why_not_breadth-first-search">Why not breadth-first search?</h4>

<p>
This assignment does not reuse your breadth-first search algorithm.
A breadth-first search between two nodes finds the path with the fewest
number of edges.  In a weighted graph, it does not always find the minimum-cost path. In the example
below, a breadth-first search from A to B would find the
path <tt>{⟨A,B⟩}</tt> with total cost 10. But the alternative
path <tt>{⟨A,C⟩,⟨C,D⟩,⟨D,B⟩}</tt> has a total cost of 3,
making it a lower-cost path even though it has more edges.
</p>

<div id="Graph-Image">
  <img src="min-cost-path.png" alt="A graph with a minimum-cost path of 3">
  <div class="caption">A graph whose minimum-cost path is not found by BFS.</div>
</div>

<p>
Breadth-first search gives the same results as Dijkstra's algorithm when
all edge weights are 1.
</p>
-->

<p>The interface of <tt>MarvelPaths2</tt> is the same as that of <tt>MarvelPaths</tt> in Homework 5, but
with a few differences in arguments and output:
</p>

<ul>
  <!--
  <li>
    Edge labels are <tt>Double</tt>s instead of <tt>String</tt>s. 
    For <strong>listChildren</strong>, the same rules as before apply
    for ordering output by nodes and edges, except that edges are now ordered
    numerically instead of lexicographically.
  </li>
  -->

  <li><strong>public void createNewGraph(String filename)</strong> is the same. 
    It creates a brand new graph and populates the graph from <i>filename</i>, where <i>filename</i> is
    a data file of the format for <tt>marvel.csv</tt> and is located in <tt>data/</tt>.
    As in Homework 5, relative paths to data files should begin at <tt>data/</tt>. 
    Consult Section "Paths to files" 
    in Homework 5 if you are having trouble making Eclipse work with these relative paths.

  <li><strong>public String findPath(String CHAR1, String CHAR2)</strong> 
    searches with Dijkstra's algorithm instead of
    BFS and returns its output in the form:

<pre>path from <em>CHAR1</em> to <em>CHARN</em>:
<em>CHAR1</em> to <em>CHAR2</em> with weight <em>w1</em>
<em>CHAR2</em> to <em>CHAR3</em> with weight <em>w2</em>
...
<em>CHARN-1</em> to <em>CHARN</em> with weight <em>wN-1</em>
total cost: <em>W</em>
</pre>

    <p>where <em>W</em> is the sum of <em>w1, w2, ..., wN-1</em>.</p>
    <p>
      In other words, the only changes in output from Homework 5 are the way the edge
      labels are printed and the addition of a "total cost" line at the
      bottom. The output should remain the same as before when no path is found
      or the characters are not in the graph: in particular, do not print the
      "total cost" line in those cases. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If there are two minimum-cost paths between <em>CHAR1</em> and <em>CHARN</em>, 
      it is undefined which one is printed.
    </p>

    <!--p>
      What if the user asks for a path from a character to itself in
      the dataset? We offer the same advice as in Homework 5: revisit
      the pseudocode algorithm. What value does it say to return in
      this case, and how would this return value be handled by findPath? 
      (A well-written solution requires no special handling of this case.)
    </p-->
  </li>
 
  <li>
    <p>
    For readability, the output of <tt>findPath</tt> should print numeric 
    values with exactly 3 digits after the decimal point, rounding to the 
    nearest value if they have more digits. The easiest way to specify the 
    desired format of a value is using format strings. For example, you 
    could create the String "Weight of 1.760" by writing:
    </p> 

   <p><tt>String.format("Weight of %.3f", 1.759555555555);</tt></p>

   <p> In <tt>findPath</tt>, the total cost should be computed by summing the full values 
    of the individual weights, not the rounded values. 
   </p>
  </li>


  <li>
        <p>As in Homework 5, a path from a character to itself should be treated as
        a trivially empty path. Because this path contains no
        edges, it has a cost of zero. (Think of the path as a list of edges.
        The sum of an empty list is conventionally defined to be zero.) So,
        your findPath should produce the usual output for a path but without
        any edges, i.e.:
        </p>

<pre>path from <em>C</em> to <em>C</em>:
total cost: 0.000</pre>

        <p>This only applies to characters in the dataset: a request for a
        path from a character that is not in the dataset to itself should
        print the usual "unknown character C" output.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>Also as in Homework 5, if the user gives two valid
  node arguments <em>CHAR1</em> and <em>CHAR2</em> that have no path in the
  specified graph, output:</p>
<pre>path from <em>CHAR1</em> to <em>CHARN</em>:
no path found
</pre>
  </li>

</ul>


<h3 id="Problem3">Problem 3: Testing Your Solution</h3>

<p>Just as with Homework 5, create smaller <tt>*.csv</tt> files to test your 
graph building and findPaths. Place them in the <tt>data/</tt> directory. Write tests in JUnit classes
and place those tests in <tt>hw6</tt> package (<tt>src/test/java/hw6/</tt> directory). Just as in
Homework 4 and 5, run EclEmma to measure your code coverage. The code coverage threshold will be set at 95% for this assignment.
</p>


<p>
Tests do not directly test the property that your graph is
generic. However, Homework 4 and Homework 5 tests use String edge
labels, while Homework 6 uses numeric values. Supporting all three test drivers
implicitly tests the generic behavior of your graph.
</p>

<h3 id="reflection">Reflection [0.5 points]</h3>

<p>Please answer the following questions in a file named <tt>hw6_reflection.pdf</tt>

  <li>In retrospect, what could you have done better to reduce the time you
  spent solving this assignment?</li>
  <li>What could the course staff have done better to improve your learning
  experience in this assignment?</li>

<h2 id="Hints">Hints</h2>
<h3 id="Documentation">Documentation</h3>
<p>
When you add generic type parameters to a class, make sure to describe
these type parameters in the class's Javadoc comments so the client
understands what they are for.
</p>
<p>
As usual, include an abstraction function, representation invariant,
and checkRep in all classes that represent an ADT. If a class does not
represent an ADT, place a comment that explicitly says so where the Abstraction 
function and Rep invariant would normally go. (For example, classes that contain only
static methods and are never constructed usually do not represent an
ADT.) Please come to office hours if you feel unsure about what counts
as an ADT and what doesn't.
</p>

<h3 id="Organization">Code Organization</h3>
<p>
In deciding how to organize your code, remember that you may need to
reuse Dijkstra's algorithm in future homework assignments. These assignments have nothing
to do with Marvel and, depending on your implementation, might use a
different generic type for nodes. How can you structure your code so
that your implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm is convenient to use
for other applications?
</p>

<h2 id="Turnin">What to Turn In</h2>
<p>You should add and commit the following files to your Git repository:</p>
