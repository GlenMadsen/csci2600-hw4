<p>As always, we recommend that you read the entire homework before you begin work. 
As always, you must commit and push to your Git repository, then submit in Submitty.</p>

<h2 id="Note 1">IMPORTANT NOTES:</h2>

<p>You should have package <tt>hw4</tt> with the usual directory structure. 
Write your code under <tt>src/main/java/hw4</tt> and your tests under <tt>src/test/java/hw4</tt> (shows as <tt>hw4</tt> under <tt>src/test/java</tt> in Package Explorer).
If your directory structure is incorrect autograding will fail resulting in a grade of 0!</p>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>
In this assignment, you will design, implement, and test a graph ADT.  Given
an abstract, high-level description of the desired ADT, you will develop a
working Java implementation. You get to choose both the public interface and
internal representation, then decide what unit tests to write to demonstrate
that your implementation works correctly.</p>

<p>Although this is an individual assignment, in the design stage you will learn
more and produce a better design by bouncing your ideas off others and
incorporating their ideas. To encourage and facilitate discussion, we are
relaxing the standard academic integrity policy for the interface design stage. 
You must first attempt to come up with an interface design on your own, but 
then you are strongly encouraged to discuss your design 
with your classmates who have also attempted a design
(as well as the course staff during office hours) as much as you like, without
restrictions on what materials you can bring to or from meetings. On the other
parts of this assignment, including the implementation stage, the standard
academic integrity policy still applies.</p>

<p>This assignment is the first of a multi-part project. 
In subsequent assignments you will build several clients of your graph ADT.
</p>

<h2 id="Graph">Building a Graph</h2>

<h3 id="Graph-Definitions">Definitions and Terminology</h3>
<p>In the rest of this assignment you will design, implement, and test
a <em>directed labeled multi-graph</em>.</p>

<p>
A <em>graph</em> is a collection of <em>nodes</em> (also called vertices) 
and <em>edges</em>. Each edge connects two nodes.
In a <em>directed graph</em>, edges are one-way: an edge <tt>e =
⟨A,B⟩</tt> indicates B that is directly reachable from A.
To indicate that B is directly reachable from A <em>and</em> A from B, a
directed graph would have edges <tt>⟨A,B⟩</tt> and <tt>⟨B,A⟩</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The <em>children</em> of node B are the nodes to which there is an
edge <em>from</em> B. In Fig. 1, the children of B are A and
C. Similarly, the parents of B are the nodes from which there is an
edge <em>to</em> B. In Fig. 1, B only has one parent, A.
</p>

<p>A <em>path</em> is a sequence of edges <tt>⟨node1,node2⟩,
⟨node2,node3⟩, ⟨node3,node4⟩, ...</tt>. In other words, a
path is an ordered list of edges, where an edge <em>to</em> some node is
immediately followed by an edge <em>from</em> that node. In Fig. 1,
one possible path is <tt>⟨B,A⟩,⟨A,B⟩,⟨B,C⟩</tt>. This
path represents traveling from B to A to B to C.  A path may traverse a
given edge more than once.
</p>

<p>A <em>reflexive edge</em> is an edge which starts and ends at the same node.
In Fig 1. there is a reflexive edge from A to A: <tt>⟨A,A⟩</tt>. Your
graph implementation must allow for reflexive edges.
</p>

  </div>
  <div class="spacer"></div>
</div>

<p>
In a <em>multigraph</em>, there can be any number of edges (zero, one,
or more) between a pair of nodes. Fig. 2 shows a multigraph with 2 edges from
A to C.
</p>

<p>
In a <em>labeled graph</em> (Fig. 3), every edge has a label containing
information of some sort. Labels are not unique: multiple edges may have
the same label. In theory a graph could contain two "identical" edges
with the same starting point, ending point, and label, but for this project
you may decide whether to allow identical edges in your implementation.
(Whatever you decide, make sure it is clearly documented so clients
understand how they can use your ADT.)
</p>

<p>
If you want to learn more, read
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28data_structure%29">Wikipedia's
  definition of a graph</a>.
Then if you still have a question, ask us.
</p>

<p>Many interesting problems can be represented with graphs.  For
example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A graph can represent airline flights between cities, where each city is
    a node and an edge <tt>⟨A,B⟩</tt> indicates that there is a flight
    from A to B. The edge label might represent the cost in money (airfare),
    time (length of flight), or distance.</li>
    <li>To find walking routes across RPI's campus in Troy, you can build a graph where
    nodes represent buildings and other locations and edges represent walking
    paths connecting two locations. The label/cost of an edge is the physical
    length of that path.</li>
    <li>The Web can be modeled as a graph with node for every Webpage and an
    edge <tt>⟨A,B⟩</tt> if page A links to page B. The label
    could indicate the anchor text for a link on page A, or the number of
    links from page A to page B.</li>
    <li>Facebook is essentially a giant graph with nodes for users and edges
    between friends. (You can see a
    <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=469716398919">visualization
    of the Facebook
    graph</a>.)</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="Problem1">Problem 1: Write a Specification for Graph</h3>

<p>To start, you will specify the API for a Java class or classes
representing a directed labeled multigraph. The API, or public
interface, is the collection of public classes and methods that clients
of your graph ADT will use. We recommend that you
work in iterative layers of detail. Start rough — preferably
with pencil and paper — by brainstorming what operations the ADT
needs to support, how it might be logically broken into modules
(classes/interfaces), and how these modules connect to each
other. Then, jot down a list of methods for each class that provide
these operations. Think through some possible client applications,
particularly finding routes between different buildings,
to get an idea about what operations might be needed. 
</p>

<p>
Initially you should keep your design rough — don't write formal class and
method specifications with all the proper clauses right away. Your design will
likely go through multiple iterations, and it's easier to throw away parts
before you've invested too much effort in them.
</p>

<p>Once you are satisfied with your high-level design, write a 
specification for each class and method. Follow
the convention we have been using in this class, remembering to use both standard Javadoc
tags (<tt>param</tt>, <tt>returns</tt>, <tt>throws</tt>) and the ones
introduced for this course (<tt>requires</tt>, <tt>effects</tt>, 
<tt>modifies</tt>, etc.) Go over 
<a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse331/13sp/conceptual-info/specifications.html">
the UW handout on specifications again.</a> 
A good approach is to create skeleton implementations of your classes
containing only method “stubs”, then write your
specifications in place in the code. A stub is a not-yet-implemented
method whose body simply throws an exception, as you saw in the
Homework 3 starter code. Stubbing out a class gives you the
flexibility to write client code and tests that use it before
completing the implementation. The skeleton code will not behave
correctly or pass tests, but the program will compile and run.</p>

<p>For this assignment, you may restrict your graph to store the data in nodes
and edge labels as <tt>String</tt>s. We strongly recommend you <span class="firered">
DO NOT</span> use Generics for this assignment.
In a future assignment, you will use generics to
make your ADT work with other data types — text, integers, doubles,
etc.  You may assume nodes are uniquely identified by their data
contents: that is, no two nodes store the same data.</p>

<p>Design problems such as this one are open-ended by nature: we are not looking
for one “right” design. There are principles of good design you have learned in
lecture, however. You will also find suggestions of what to consider and how to
approach the problem in the <a href="#Hints">hints</a> section. Also, designs naturally
evolve as requirements change, so try to make your code extensible, but don't
over-generalize.</p>

<p>Once you are done with the specification of your Graph ADT (overview and operations) copy and
paste your specs and stubs into the file <tt>answers/problem1.pdf</tt>.

<!--
<p>
Please include in your submission a brief description (at most one sentence for
each operation) of why you included the operations you
did and why you feel they are a sufficient interface to a graph. If
your design includes multiple classes or interfaces, explain why you
included each one; if not, explain whether you considered additional
classes and why you decided not to include them. This should be placed
in <tt>hw4/answers/problem2.txt</tt>. The only other deliverables
for this problem are the Javadoc class and method
specifications as they appear in the source code you submit
in <a href="#Problem4">Problem 4</a>; you do not need to submit your
Javadoc in a separate file.</p>
-->

<h3 id="Problem2">Problem 2: Write Tests for Graph</h3>

<p>Write a black-box test suite for your Graph specifications. It is important
to write your tests <b>before</b> your code, but your tests will not pass until you have
completed <a href="#Problem3">Problem 3</a>. </p>

<li><strong>Documentation:</strong>
Include with your test cases one short paragraph of documentation
explaining your testing strategy, and which (if any) testing heuristics
you used. Place this writeup in <tt>answers/problem2.pdf</tt>.

<!-- TODO: think about automation in the future -->
<!-- TODO: specification tests versus implementation tests -->

<p>Create and commit new JUnit test classes in directory <tt>src/test/java/hw4</tt>. 
You must have a JUnit test case for <tt>GraphWrapper</tt> placed into file 
<tt>src/test/java/hw4/GraphWrapperTest.java</tt> which should already exist in your repository. 
(<tt>GraphWrapper</tt> is explained in <a href="#Problem3">Problem 3</a>.) You may need to add other files later on.
To create a new test case,
right-click on <tt>hw4</tt> under <tt>src/test/java</tt>, then New -> JUnit Test Case, then type a name for the new test class.
And don't forget to add JUnit!   
Look back to Homework 0 and Homework 3 as examples of extensive test suites. 
</p>

<h3 id="Problem3">Problem 3: Implement Graph</h3>

A Java source code file <tt>GraphWrapper.java</tt> for the <tt>GraphWrapper</tt> class (it is explained shortly after) should already exist in your repository. If you later need to add other Java source code files, right-click on <tt>hw4</tt> under <tt>src/main/java</tt>, 
then New -> Class, Package: <tt>hw4</tt>, and then enter the name of the class to be created. 
</p>

<p>
There are many ways to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28data_structure%29#Representations">represent</a>
a graph.  Here are a few:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>As a collection of edges.</li>
  <li>As an adjacency list, in which each node is associated with a list of
    its outgoing edges.
  </li>
  <li>As an adjacency matrix, which explicitly represents, for every pair
  ⟨A,B⟩ of edges, whether there is a link from A to B, and how many.
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>

<li>In one brief paragraph, describe your representation. For at least
  the three representations above and your representation (if it is not one
  of the ones above), explain an advantage of that representation in a sentence. 
  Given these advantages, briefly explain why you chose the
  representation you did. You should place this discussion in a file
  called <tt>answers/problem3.pdf</tt>.</li>

<li>Place a proper <b>abstraction function and representation invariant</b>
for your Graph data type (and any other ADTs you create) in your source code.
Also implement a private <tt>checkRep()</tt> method,
which will help in finding errors in your implementation.</li>

<li>Provide an implementation of your graph data type. We ask that you strive
first for a good design before worrying about performance right
now. Eventually, however, your path-finding application
will create and operate on very large graphs, so the scalability of your
Graph implementation will be important. Since the path-finding algorithm must
frequently look up the children for a given node, this operation should be
performed quickly even for large graph sizes (aim for constant time here). Your
graph building operations should also be reasonably efficient. As your
implementation will likely use classes in the Java Collections Framework, you
should understand the computational complexity of classes such as 
<a class="api" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html">HashMap</a>
and <a class="api" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a>.</li>

<li>Be sure to call your <tt>checkRep()</tt> where appropriate. </li>

<li>Once you've finished your implementation, you should think about whether or
not new tests are needed in addition to those you wrote before you started
coding.  If so, you should add these to your test suite. 
You should <b>append to the end of your test strategy writeup</b> in
<a href="#Problem2">Problem 2</a> a description of any
new tests you added, or why you feel that your original tests
alone are sufficient. At this point you <b>must install <a href="http://www.eclemma.org/">EclEmma</a></b> 
(through the Eclipse Marketplace), which measures your code coverage. 
Look for coverage of package <tt>hw4</tt> in EclEmma. You must achieve 75% or higher coverage for <tt>hw4</tt>
to receive full credit on this part.
We measure the coverage of your test suite --- the higher the coverage, the higher the grade.
</li>
</ol>

<p>You have freedom to design the Graph ADT as you wish (you can name your class,
include operations as you chose, choose the rep as you like). However, we require that
you implement an additional class, <code>GraphWrapper</code> which has an instance field
of type your Graph ADT, and implements the following weakly specified public methods. 
You don't have to write rep invariant, abstraction function or checkRep() 
for <code>GraphWrapper</code>. <code>GraphWrapper</code>
does not represent an ADT, it simply redirects the work to your Graph ADT.
You do need to write a test suite <code>GraphWrapperTest.java</code> in 
directory <tt>src/test/java/hw4</tt>.
The purpose of <code>GraphWrapper</code> is to allow us to test your Graph ADT through
a common interface. Below is the abstract description of the operations in <code>GraphWrapper</code>.
</p>

<dt><tt>public GraphWrapper()</tt></dt>
<dd>This is the constructor of <tt>GraphWrapper</tt>. It initializes the instance field
with a new empty instance of your Graph ADT.
</dd>

<dt><tt>public void addNode(String nodeData)</tt></dt>
<dd>Adds a node represented by the string <tt>nodeData</tt> to your graph.
If an identical node already exists in the graph, the output of <tt>addNode</tt> is
not defined, that is, it is left at your discretion.
</dd>

<dt><tt>public void addEdge(String parentNode, String childNode, String edgeLabel)</tt></dt>
<dd>Creates an edge from
<tt>parentNode</tt> to <tt>childNode</tt> with label <tt>edgeLabel</tt> in your
graph. If either of the nodes does not exist in the graph,
the output of this command is not defined. If an identical edge (same parent,
child, and label) already exists, the output of this command is not defined
either, as it is left at your discretion whether to allow identical edges in
your implementation.
</dd>

<dt><tt>public Iterator&lt;String&gt; listNodes()</tt></dt>
<dd>This operation has no effect on your graph.
It returns an iterator which returns the nodes in
lexicographical (alphabetical) order.
</dd>

<dt><tt>public Iterator&lt;String&gt; listChildren(String parentNode)</tt></dt>
<dd>This operation has no effect on your graph.
It returns iterator which returns the list of <tt>childNode(edgeLabel)</tt> in
lexicographical (alphabetical) order by node name and secondarily
by edge label. <tt>childNode(edgeLabel)</tt> means there is an edge with
label <tt>edgeLabel</tt> from <tt>parentNode</tt> to <tt>childNode</tt>. If there are multiple
edges from <tt>parentNode</tt> to some <tt>childNode</tt>, there should be separate
entry for each edge. If there is a reflexive edge, <tt>parentNode(edgeLabel)</tt>
should be in the list.
</dd>

<h2 id="Hints">Hints</h2>

<h3 id="WritingSpecs">Writing Specifications</h3>

<p>To give you some sense of the kinds of issues you should be
considering in your design, here are some questions you might want to
consider. These don't in general have simple answers. You'll need to
exercise judgment, and think carefully about how decisions you
make interfere with each other.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Will the graph be mutable or immutable?</li>

  <li>Will the graph be implemented as a single class, or will there
  be a Java interface for the Graph specification and a separate
  class for the implementation?</li>

  <li>Will edges be objects in their own right? Will they be visible
  to a client of the abstract type?</li>
  
  <li>Will nodes be objects in their own right? Will they be visible
  to a client of the abstract type?</li>
  
  <li>When will the user specify the nodes and/or edges in the graph? (In the
  constructor? With an insertion method? Both? Can the user add multiple nodes
  and/or edges at once?)</li>

  <li>What kind of iterators will the type provide?</li>

  <li>Will the type provide any views, like the set view returned by
  the <code>entrySet()</code> method of <a class="api" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html">java.util.Map</a>?</li>

  <li>Will the type implement any standard Java collection
  interfaces?</li>

  <li>Will the type use any standard Java collections in its
implementation?</li>

</ul>

<p>
In choosing what operations/methods to include, strive to include enough that
the ADT will be convenient and useful for a client, but avoid the temptation to
write an “everything but the kitchen sink” API. Generally speaking, it is better
to design a minimal than a maximal API. In the real world, you can always add
methods later. However, you can never remove them from a published API, and such
methods may over-constrain the implementation in the future.
</p>

<p>Make good use of the course staff.  If you have concrete questions,
then take your specification to office hours
to get some feedback on your design and
style. This is likely to save you a lot of time!</p>


<h3 id="Working_Incrementally">Working Incrementally</h3>

<p>Although it is generally a bad idea to start coding before you have thought
deeply, it often makes sense to work incrementally, interleaving design and
coding. Once you have a sketch of your specification, you may want to write some
experimental code. This should give you some concrete feedback on how easy it is
to implement the methods you've specified. You may even want to start at the
end, and write the code that uses your type, so that you can be confident that
the methods you provide will be sufficient.
</p>

<p>This strategy can backfire and degenerate into mindless hacking, leaving you
with a pile of low-quality code and an incoherent specification. To avoid that,
bear three things in mind:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>You must be willing to start again:
experimental code isn't experimental if you're not prepared to throw it
away. </li>
  <li>Whenever you start coding, you must have a firm idea of what
you're trying to implement. There's no point starting to code to a specification
that is vague and missing crucial details. That doesn't mean that your
specification must be complete and polished, but it does mean that you shouldn't
start coding a method until at least you have its own specification
written. </li> 
  <li>You <em>must</em> write down the specification of a method and
not just imagine it; it's too easy to delude yourself. Try to write it on paper
and mull it over before you start any coding. It's tempting to sit in front of
an editor, write some specification as comments, and then start coding around
them, but this tends not to be nearly so effective.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Designing_Tests">Designing Tests</h3>

<p>It can be difficult to come up with a good test suite.  You would like to
test a variety of “interesting” graphs, but what are interesting
graphs?  One possible approach is a “0, 1, 2” case analysis: test
scripts with 0, 1, and 2 graphs are interesting; graphs with 0, 1, and 2 nodes
and 0, 1, and 2 edges are interesting.  For each method, 0, 1, and 2 parameters
and 0, 1, and 2 results are interesting; for example: addEdge on nodes that
  currently have 0, 1, and 2 children;
listChildren on nodes with
0, 1, and 2 children; etc.
<!--, findPath with 0, 1,and 2 start nodes, 0, 1,and 2 goal
nodes, and 0, 1,and 2 paths found.
-->
  This approach, while certainly not required,
can give a good way to structure your tests to cover many important cases
without having too much redundancy.
Use EclEmma to measure your coverage and gain even more confidence in your tests.</p>

<h3 id="af-ri-checkrep">Abstraction function, representation invariant, and checkRep</h3>
<p>
  Include an abstraction function, representation invariant, and
  private <tt>checkRep()</tt> method in all new classes you create
  that represent an ADT. If a class does not represent an ADT, place a
  comment that explicitly says so where the AF and RI would normally
  go. (For example, classes that contain only static methods and are
  never constructed usually do not represent an ADT — though you
  are unlikely to write any such classes for HW4.) Please come to
  office hours if you feel unsure about what counts as an ADT and what
  doesn't.
</p>

<p>Be conscious of how certain operations in <tt>checkRep()</tt>,
particularly iterating over a large dataset, may affect the
“big-O” runtime of your methods. If your program suffers
performance problems in Homework 4 or 5, <tt>checkRep()</tt> is a good
place to start looking for problems.</p>

<p>It is hard to balance the utility of the <tt>checkRep()</tt> method
with how expensive it may be to run.  A good approach is to call
<tt>checkRep()</tt> as much as possible (generally at the beginning
and end of every method), but to <strong>disable the <tt>checkRep()</tt>
when you turn in your code so that our tests don't timeout.</strong>  
A good way to do this is to have a static final
constant variable that is checked in your <tt>checkRep()</tt> such 
that it only runs when the constant variable is set.</p>

<h3 id="hashCode-Warning">A warning about equals and hashCode</h3>
<p> You may find it useful to define a class or classes that implement method equals. If you do that, <em>be sure</em>
 to also provide a consistent definition of method hashCode, otherwise 
your objects may behave strangely if used in containers like HashMaps. 
There is a good discussion of the issues involved in <em>Effective Java</em> (item 10 in the 3rd edition).</p>

<h3 id="Generics-Warning">A warning about using generics</h3>
<p>
You are permitted <span class="important">but discouraged</span> from implementing generic classes on this assignment
(that will come later). A generic class is one defined as something like
</p>
<pre>public class Graph&lt;N,E&gt; {
   ...
}
</pre>
<p>
where a client could then construct a <tt>Graph&lt;String,String&gt;</tt>,
<tt>Graph&lt;City,Road&gt;</tt>, etc.
</p>

<p>If you choose to write a generic class, be aware that Eclipse's
built-in compiler sometimes handles generics differently
from <tt>javac</tt>, the standard command-line compiler. 
</p>

<p>
This warning is only directed at students writing their own generic classes. Simply
using, say, a <tt>List&lt;String&gt;</tt> or <tt>Comparator&lt;Foo&gt;</tt> (as
you have been doing all along) should be fine.
